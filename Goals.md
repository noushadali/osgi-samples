# Introduction #

Januari 2007 Allard and Jettro were discussing the osgi initiative and the opportunities this gives for their projects. Together they decided to identify the possibilities and create some samples. At the moment the focus is versioning of webservices and creating interfaces via the web.


# Details #

## Main Goal ##
Identifying the possibilities for osgi in combination with web projects and webservices. The goal is to come to a sample application demonstrating the versioning possibilities for webservices using osgi.

## Scope ##
At first we focus on learning osgi via equinox and there available OsgiStandardComponents. If that area is explorer the step to http://www.springframework.org/osgi is made.
